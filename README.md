# Github Workshop
Welcome to your first workshop of CS50! Here, you'll learn how to use Github, a version control system that allows for teams to concurrently work on the same code efficiently. Knowing how to use Github will be important both for this class and for a lot of future software development you'll do in the future. Let's get started!

## Getting Started
### What is Github?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects without always having to be in the same place.

This tutorial will teach you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code. The tutorial relies on using the command line interface, but all of these tasks can also be done without using the command line.

### Setup Instructions
To follow along this tutorial, you need to have **(1) a Github account** and **(2) Install Git on your computer/machine**. If you choose not to install Git on your machine, refer to the slides on how to use Git without the command line!

#### 1. Getting a Github Account
Navigating to www.github.com will lead you to the Github home page where you can sign up for an account. When signing up, choose the **free** personal plan option, which will let you create unlimited public repositories. Later in this guide, we walk you through how to activate your snazzy **student package**.

#### 2. Installing Git
For this step, it is easiest if you just refer to Github's default setup article: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

Follow the instructions for:
- Downloading/Installing the lastest version of Git,
- Setting your username in Git, and
- Setting your email in Git

After doing this step, you should be able to type "git" into your command line and get meaningful output. You're all set!

## The Tutorial
### 1. Repositories
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. Typically, these repositories, or repos, will be used to house all the code + necessary materials for your project.
#### Cloning This Repository
This workshop will revolve around you (and everyone else) playing with this repository. To get started, you'll need to **clone** this repository on your machine. Think about cloning a repository as downloading a copy of that repo onto your local machine. To do this:
1. Create an empty folder somewhere on your machine
2. Navigate to that folder using your command line/Terminal
3. Once inside that folder, type: *git clone https://github.com/CS50Stanford/GithubWorkshop.git*

#### (Optional) Creating your own new repository
Cloning repos are nice, but say you want to start your own new project. Here's how you'd make your own repo:
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click the **+** and then select **New Repository**.
2. Name your repository.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select Initialize this repository with a README.
5. Click **Create Repository**
