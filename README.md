# Github Workshop
Welcome to your first workshop of CS50! Here, you'll learn how to use Github, a version control system that allows for teams to concurrently work on the same code efficiently. Knowing how to use Github will be important both for this class and for a lot of future software development you'll do in the future. Let's get started!

## Getting Started
### What is Github?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects without always having to be in the same place.

This tutorial will teach you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

### Setup Instructions
To follow along this tutorial, you need to have **(1) a Github account** and **(2) Install Git on your computer/machine**. 

#### 1. Getting a Github Account
Navigating to www.github.com will lead you to the Github home page where you can sign up for an account. When signing up, choose the **free** personal plan option, which will let you create unlimited public repositories. Later in this guide, we walk you through how to activate your snazzy **student package**.

#### 2. Installing Git
